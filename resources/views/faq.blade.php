                        <h4>Why?</h4>
                        <p>I started writing this site because lately I've been feeling incredibly lazy and deep down inside I hoped it would
                            motivate me to continue working out. This site has done that. Since the creation of this site I have worked out
                            ever single day.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Can you add exercise X?</h4>
                        <p>Sure just use the link at the bottom of the page to suggest an exercise.</p>
                        <h4>Can you add an entire missing category of exercises?</h4>
                        <p>Take a look at the previous answer.</p>
                        <h4>What's coming next?</h4>
                        <p>I have a bunch of planned features like workout cloning. More detailed editing of workouts. Links to videos describing
                        different exercises, and my favorite planned feature will be the ability to attach a picture to a workout so you can watch
                        your progress.
                        </p>
                        <h4>What's your privacy policy?</h4>
                        <p>That's such a huge topic in this day of internet security that it has it's own page.</p>
                        <h4>Why does the site look terrible on my browser.</h4>
                        <p>I am not a graphic designer, as such the site was written using bootstrap on my laptop's browser. I will continue to
                            improve the look and feel of the site as best I can. This will take some time as I get better at accomodating browser
                            sizes and types.
                        </p>
                        <h4>What engine does your site use?</h4>
                        <p>This website is running Laravel 5.0 on php 5.6.x.</p>
